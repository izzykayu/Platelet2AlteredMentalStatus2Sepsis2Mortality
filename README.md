* Delirium is a symptom of acute brain dysfunction that involves the following combination of symptoms: acute change or fluctuation from baseline mental status, inattention, and disorganized thinking or altered level of consciousness. Patients who are delirious may experience hallucinations, delusions, or hyperactivity, but these symptoms are not present in all delirious patients. In fact, three different forms of delirium have been described based on the symptoms that patients demonstrate. In hyperactive delirium, patients are agitated, while in hypoactive delirium they are calm or lethargic. Patients with mixed delirium fluctuate between these two subtypes.37 Delirium occurs at least once during the ICU stay in up to 80% of critically ill patients and is associated with negative patient outcomes, including increased mortality, ICU and hospital-length of stay, long-term cognitive impairment, and health care costs.[1]*


* We search for potential indicators in labs (specifically exploring platelets), events, notes, and other peices of EHR to detect delirium and sepsis
* SQL, R, and Python used
